## Week 1 Progress Report

* Started installation of Approxlyzer

   I started the process of installing Approxilyzer into 'shared/workspace/aditikg2'. For this I installed GEMS. But, when I tried to install SIMICS, I needed a decryption key to actually run the SIMICS installer.

* Created a git to upload code and to submit progress reports.

* Halfway through reading the research paper on Approxilyzer.
