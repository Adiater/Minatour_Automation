## Week 6 Progress Report
##### 27 Feb, 2019 to 5 Mar, 2019

* Created a function that gets the quality of a file relative to the reference file. This function takes as its inputs the name of the coverage file produced for the input and a list of line numbers covered by the refernece as it other input.

* Created a get_quality function that works with the help of keywords for all apps to get quality given an input. The specifics of how to run this is in "code/general/README.md".

* Wrote a programs.py that makes it easier to give inputs for known apps.
